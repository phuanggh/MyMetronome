# My Metronome

MyMetronome is a lightweight metronome app. It shows glowing animation at every beat, and uses white glowing to distinguish the first beat of a measure from the rest. Any change in time signature and tempo marking will be updated immediately.

The beat sounds is able be muted so that users can focus on the music they are playing, but still follow tempo through the glowing and beat dot visual effects.
